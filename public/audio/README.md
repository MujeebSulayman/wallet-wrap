# Audio Files

Place your background music file here as `ambient.mp3`

## Recommended:
- Use royalty-free ambient/electronic music
- Format: MP3 or OGG
- Duration: 2-5 minutes (will loop)
- Style: Ambient, chill, electronic - something that fits the wrapped aesthetic

## Free Music Sources:

## Alternative:
If you don't have a music file, the app will work without it - just won't play audio.
